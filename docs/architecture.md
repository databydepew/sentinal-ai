## Overview

Sentinel AI is a distributed system designed to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate ML incidents in production environments. The system follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication and autonomous AI agents.

### Key Design Principles

- **Autonomous Operation**: AI agents work independently with minimal human intervention
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive system that responds to incidents and state changes
- **Scalable**: Horizontally scalable components to handle enterprise workloads
- **Resilient**: Fault-tolerant design with graceful degradation
- **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging throughout the system
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom agents and integrations

### Base Agent Architecture

```python

    def __init__(self, agent_id: str, capabilities: List[AgentCapability]):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        self.state = AgentState.IDLE
        self.message_queue = MessageQueue()
        self.knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase()
    
    async def process_incident(self, incident: Incident) -> AgentAction:
        # Core processing logic
        pass
    
    async def handle_message(self, message: AgentMessage) -> None:
        # Inter-agent communication
        pass
    
    def get_capabilities(self) -> List[AgentCapability]:
        return self.capabilities
```

### Agent Communication

**Message Types**:
- `TASK_ASSIGNMENT`: New task from conductor

- `RESULT_NOTIFICATION`: Task completion
- `COLLABORATION_REQUEST`: Inter-agent coordination
- `ESCALATION`: Human intervention needed

**Communication Patterns**:

- **Publish-Subscribe**: Event-driven updates and notifications
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous task processing
- **Direct Invocation**: High-priority urgent communications

### Agent State Management

```python
class AgentState(Enum):
    IDLE = "idle"
    PROCESSING = "processing"
    WAITING = "waiting"
    ERROR = "error"
    MAINTENANCE = "maintenance"
```

**State Transitions**:
- Agents maintain state in Redis for persistence
- State changes trigger events for monitoring
- Automatic recovery from error states
- Graceful shutdown and restart capabilities

## Data Flow

7. **Processing**: Agents execute their specialized functions
8. **Coordination**: Results shared between agents
9. **Resolution**: Incident marked as resolved
10. **Reporting**: Final reports generated and distributed
